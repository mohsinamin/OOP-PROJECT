PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
As we can guess that this name of project is clearly indicating that it contains a maza and an person is running,
his time of acheiving or we can say winning is being recorded.
As we have played and clearly see different games but this maze runner game is quite difficult to be implemented in
Visual Studio defining the positions at different points so this was the idea to implement that game in Unity in the 3D.

In this game, A player is trapped inside the maze and he has to find the way out in the given time.
He has the controls Arrow key[UP,DOWN,LEFT RIGHT] for movements.
